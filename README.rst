Introduction
============

Our focus is on the influence of thermohaline convection on the solidification and melting process of ice in polar seas.

We use a standard Lattice Boltzmann equation solver to integrate the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to advection-diffusion equations for temperature and salt. Phase transition processes is implemented via the enthalpy formulation.

This project is based at Mechanics Laboratory of Lille (LML) France.
